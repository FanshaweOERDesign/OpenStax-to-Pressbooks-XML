## OpenStax to PressbooksXML Converter

This app converts online textbooks hosted by [OpenStax](https://openstax.org) to Pressbooks XML files. In the process it extracts the images from the OpenStax resource and renames them for easy bulk import into your Pressbooks resource. To use the app, visit either this repo's GH Pages deployment or access the app from [AppHub](https://fanshaweoerdesign.github.io/AppHub/).
