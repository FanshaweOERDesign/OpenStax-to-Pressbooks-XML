## OpenStax to PressbooksXML Converter

This app converts online textbooks hosted by [OpenStax](https://openstax.org) to Pressbooks XML files. In the process, it also extracts the images from the OpenStax resource and renames them for easy bulk import into your Pressbooks resource, converts textboxes to Pressbooks textboxes, and adds attributions to the output Pressbooks pages. To use the app, visit either this repo's deployment or access the app from [AppHub](https://fanshaweoerdesign.github.io/AppHub/).
